* Reusable Layout patterns
* Only LAYOUT related properties that can

* NO COSMETIC STYLING ALLOWED IN HERE
*
* I find it useful to have a site/page layout for distributing the main elements.
* You may have want to split into views, and put them in a folder
*
* You can have as many objects as you like.
*
* Having a look at Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell's Every Layout (https://every-layout.dev/)
* can give you ideas of all the layouts you might need.
* Another source of ideas is haiticss's objects folder: https://github.com/haiticss/haiticss/tree/master/src/objects
*
* I include the famous media object as an example
