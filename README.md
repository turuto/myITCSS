# myITCSS

This is my take on ITCSS. I am deeply in love with ITCSS proposal by Harry Roberts as it provides a versatile and modular CSS architecture that has proved to be scalable and  maintainable.

ITCSS is not a framework but a methodology. So since then, I decided to follow his foundations while building and refining my own CSS base project.

Later I learnt the feature toggling system by Dani Fornells when I was reading his Inuit.CSS and so I brought it to my project. Since then, this has grown a lot, but as long as it doesn't spit out unwanted CSS, I don't delete any component, just evolve them.

Whenever I see an interesting take on one problem, I try to bring it in. References are escattered throughout the code, and place

This project has been growing, but
## References
This project is based mainly on:
  * [ITCSS](wwww.ITCSS.io) by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) and his approach in  [INUIT.css]([www.inuit.css](https://github.com/inuitcss)).
  * [HAITI.css](https://github.com/haiticss/haiticss) by Dani Fornells.
  * [BEM](http://getbem.com/) naming convention

## Folder structure  and code organization:
The only one thing I didn't like about the original ITCSS proposal was that the folder naming was alphabetically sortable. So the organization in the IDE didn't reflect the layer order that was one of the core foundations of the methodology. With a numeric prefix this issue is solved, and it makes the system clearer to those not so much experienced with ITCSS.

### What can I find inside those folders/layers?
